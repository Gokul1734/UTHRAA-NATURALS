## Backend Setup

The system uses Nodemailer with fallback to Ethereal Email for testing. For production, configure your SMTP settings:

#### Option 1: Gmail (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Add to your .env file
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=Uthraa Naturals <your-email@gmail.com>
```

#### Option 2: Outlook/Hotmail
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=Uthraa Naturals <your-email@outlook.com>
```

#### Option 3: Custom SMTP
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=Uthraa Naturals <your-email@domain.com>
```

### 3. API Endpoints Created

  </AdminRoute>
} />
```

### 2. Navigation
The Users menu item is already configured in `AdminLayout.jsx` and will appear in the admin sidebar.
